      Reagan, whom his father was a fan of.[18] His mother revealed that she
      wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism, and having
      too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the
      procedure.[19][20] Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Catholic home,
      sharing a room with all his siblings.[21]

      Ronaldo began his senior career with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sporting_CP">Sporting CP,</a>, before signing with
      Manchester United in 2003, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He went
      on to become a star player at United, as they won three consecutive
      Premier League titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup;
      his 2007–08 season earned him his first Ballon d'Or, aged 23. Ronaldo was
      the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when
      he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80
      million). He was integral to Madrid becoming a dominant force again, as
      they won four Champions Leagues from 2014 to 2018, including La Décima. He
      won back-to-back Ballon d'Or awards in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016
      and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his perceived
      career rival. He also became the club's all-time top goalscorer and
      finished as the Champions League's top scorer for six consecutive seasons
      between 2012 and 2018. With Madrid, Ronaldo's additional titles include
      two La Liga titles, including a record-breaking title win in 2011-12, and
      two Copas del Rey. In 2018, following issues with the Madrid hierarchy,
      Ronaldo made a surprise transfer to Juventus in a transfer worth an
      initial €100 million (£88 million). He won several trophies in Italy,
      including two Serie A titles and a Coppa Italia, and broke several records
      for Juventus. He returned to United in 2021; despite a collectively
      disappointing season, Ronaldo's individual performances earned him being
      included in the PFA Team of the Year at 37 years old. His contract was
      terminated in 2022 due to a fall out with the newly appointed manager, and
      in 2023 he signed for Al-Nassr, a move that has since been widely credited
      for revolutionising football in Saudi Arabia.

    <p style="font-size: x-large;">At age 16, Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting's youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni, who was impressed with his dribbling.[1] He subsequently became the first player to play for the club's under-16, under-17 and under-18 teams, the B team and the first team, all within a single season.[2]

       On 14 August 2002,[3] Ronaldo, then 17, played his first official match for the first team, in a UEFA Champions League qualifying round at José Alvalade Stadium against Inter Milan. He came on in the 58th[3] minute in place of Toñito.[4][5]</p>

    <p style="font-size: x-large;">Ronaldo's move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003, too late for the 2003 FA Community Shield but in time for their game against Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003–04 season, and made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club.[16] His transfer fee made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history.[17] Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona and David Beckham.[18] Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.[19] A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: "He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career"</p>

    <ul><li style="font-size: xx-large;">REAL MADRID FC</ul></li>
    <p style="font-size: x-large;">Cristiano Ronaldo is a part of Real Madrid's legacy and will forever be remember as one of the great icons throughout the club's history. He was unveiled at the Santiago Bernabéu on 6 July 2009, where he was joined by Eusebio and Alfredo Di Stéfano, and since that day, the goals just kept coming. He netted 451 times in 438 competitive appearances with Real Madrid (averaging over a goal a game). He registered in all of the competitions he featured in: 312 in LaLiga, 105 in the Champions League, 22 in the Copa del Rey, six in the Club World Cup, four in the Spanish Super Cup and two in the UEFA Super Cup.

      Nobody throughout the club's history has scored as many goals as the Portuguese attacker, who boasts an impressive trophy haul as a Real Madrid player: four Champions League crowns, three Club World Cups and UEFA Super Cups apiece, two LaLiga titles, a pair of Copas del Rey and two Spanish Super Cups. This list of honours is completed with four Ballons d'Or, three Golden Shoe awards, two The Best awards, whilst he was named UEFA Best Player in Europe three times and landed the Pichichi crown on three occasions.</p>

  <P style="font-size: x-large;">Ronaldo joined Juventus in 2018 for €100 million, the transfer was the highest ever for a player over 30 years old and the highest paid by an Italian club.[142] Upon signing, Ronaldo cited his need for a new challenge as his rationale for departing Madrid,[143] but later attributed the transfer to the lack of support he felt was shown by club president Florentino Pérez.[144]

    On 18 August, Ronaldo made his debut in a 3–2 away win against Chievo Verona.[145] On 19 September, in his first Champions League match for Juve, he was sent off against Valencia, his first red card in 154 Champions League appearances.[146] In the reverse (home) leg against Valencia, Cristiano won 100 Champions League matches, becoming the first ever player to do so.</P>

<ul><li style="font-size: xx-large;">Al_Nassr FC</ul></li>
<p style="font-size: xx-large;">On 30 December 2022, Saudi Arabian club Al-Nassr reached an agreement for Ronaldo to join the club, signing a contract until 2025.[190] Ronaldo received the highest football salary ever, at €200 million per year,[191][192] including a guaranteed football salary of €90 million, with commercial and sponsorship deals bringing his total annual salary to €200 million.

  He made his debut for Al-Nassr on 22 January 2023, as club captain, playing the full 90 minutes of a 1–0 win over Al-Ettifaq,[193] and scored his first goal in a 2–2 draw against Al-Fateh by converting a last-minute penalty.[194] On 9 February, Ronaldo scored all four goals in a 4–0 win over Al-Wehda, his first goal of the match being his 500th career league goal.[195] According to the BBC, Ronaldo's transfer to Al-Nassr led a "revolution" in Asian football, with many players from other leagues, particularly those in Europe, transferring to Saudi Pro League clubs for the 2023–24 season.</p>
